ApplicationBehavior:
  - Jobs without order being defined are considered to be zero ordered
  - Jobs should honor the order they are in, only jobs that are in same order can be executed concurrently at a given time
  - When One job fails, all other running jobs should be cancelled within the grace period

Cases To be Tested:
  - when only single job
  - when two or more than two jobs
  - when one of stack fails
  - change the order of the job to 0, 1, 2
  - when multiple failures are seen in different jobs
  - log readability

Done
  - strict ordering of stacks in a job
  - dry-run
  - environment variable support
  - logging mgmt

Features
  - cli wrapper
  - retry mechanism
  - proper timeout


CodeEnhancements:
  - job dispatch mechanism
  - variable naming convention
