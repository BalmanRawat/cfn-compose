Sanity Check for Flows
- when no order is given at all(good)
- when no order is given at all(good)
- when we mix order and no order(good)
- when we reach max flows or more than max(good)
- when no flows is provided(good)

Sanity Check for Stacks
- when stack_template file or url is missing(good)
- when both stack_template and url is provided(good)
- when no stack is given per flows(good)
- strict sequencing of stacks creation(good)

Sanity check for workflow
- when environment variable like aws-profile/region, env_type, env_label missing(good)
- Invalid workflow file/format(good)
- Workflow file missing or WORKFLOW variable's invalid value(good)
- when vars section is not provided, also test if null or non existent vars are referenced(good)
- when vars are declared but value is not provided(needs Enhancements)

Sanity check for features:
  - retry mechanism(needs time to test)
  - Is logging reliable or not and shows logs as per the sequence
    - log levels working or not
    - is every log comprehensive enough to get insight out it
    - all logs should tie with flow and stack if relevant 
  - dry-run/non-dry run mode(good)
  - detects change-sets or not(good)
  - cli wrapper(good)

Enhancements
  - Support Retry Count
  - targeting specific flows or stack
  - centralized tagging/parameters
  - generate graphs from the config file
  - set Current Working directory (no need)
  - pass the concurrency flag (no need)

Vars Section
  - think of handling the empty template variable case
  - think of handling where var is declared but empty
  - Thinking of multiple stages

Validations:
  - stack names
  - external properties

Handle Edge cases:
  - ask for input before applying the delete
